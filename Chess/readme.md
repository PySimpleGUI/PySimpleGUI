# PySimpleGUI-Chess A Chess Game Playback Program

## Introduction
This is the start of a front-end GUI for an AI engine that plays chess.  It simply reads moves the a PGN file and steps through it showing each of the moves on the board.

If you get an error __ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chess'__, then do __pip install python-chess__

To play against an AI on Windows, run the program
__Demo_Chess_AGAINST_AI.py__

Locate where the pacakge was installed and run the programs from that folder.  You need to run from the installed folder so that the images of the chess pieces are located.
