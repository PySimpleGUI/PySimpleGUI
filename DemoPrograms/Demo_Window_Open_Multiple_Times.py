    Demo Restart Window (sorta reopen)
    
    Once a window is closed, you can't do anything with it.  You can't read it.  You can't "re-open" it.
    The only choice is to recreate the window.  It's important that you use a "Fresh Layout" every time.
    You can't pass the same layout from one indow to another.  You will get a popup error infomrning you
    that you've attempted to resuse a layout.

    The purpose of this demo is to show you the simple "make window" design pattern.  It simply makes a 
    window using a layout that's defined in that function and returns the Window object.  It's not a bad
    way to encapsulate windows if your applcation is gettinga little larger than the typical small data
    entry window.
