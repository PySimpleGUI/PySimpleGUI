## 2. PySimpleGUI Shutdown

We gave it our best shot… After 7 years of attempting to make the PySimpleGUI project sustainable, we are ending active development.

If you've followed the project over the years, you'll have read about the difficulties maintaining such an endeavor.

### One Year Update PySimpleGUI 5

It’s been a little over a year since the release of PySimpleGUI 5. Of the 100,000+ registrations, only a small portion have been able to financially support the project.

### End of PySimpleGUI Project

The revenue generated was not enough to cover the basic costs, so we've decided to sunset the project.

### Support for Commercial Users

Unlike traditional software companies, stopping business means support ends; however:

- Your license doesn’t expire, so you’ll be able to continue running your applications.
- Hobbyists can continue using PySimpleGUI 5 until their keys expire. After that, the free version will still work.

If you want to use PySimpleGUI without the key expiring or want support, options exist to continue with commercial licenses.

### Websites Availability

The PySimpleGUI registration and documentation websites will continue to operate for some time.

### Business Partnership Inquiries

If you're a business with a serious partnership that you wish to discuss, please email the project contact.
